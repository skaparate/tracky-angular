# Tracky Angular

This is the [Angular Tracky web client](https://tracky-angular.nicomv.com/) (live sample), which is the front end for the Free Code Camp's *Information Security and Quality Assurance Projects - Issue Tracker* API project.

The project is proxied for local development, which can be configured in the file `proxy.config.json`. By default, the proxy translates every request that starts with *api/* to `localhost:3100`.

The API can be downloaded/cloned from https://github.com/skaparate/fcc-issue-tracker.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 8.3.19.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` or `npm start` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `npm build` to build the project production ready. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `npm test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `npm e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
